The primary goal of our project was to create a visualization to show the various trends in music from the 1960’s to today. Our specific code implementation goals (which we succeed in) are as follows.

The final infographic potentially answers the following questions:
 - How did the popularity of genres evolve relative to one another from 1960 to 2013 (for instance, among hip-hop, rock,      and funk, did any become more or less popular relative to the other two)?

 - What are the top 10 artists in each genre from 1960 to 2013? What are the top 5 songs by each of these artists?

 - Which ranges of song duration were most popular in which time periods from 1960 to 2013?

 - How has the statistical distribution of song durations changed from 1960 to 2013?
